Starting to learn git
#cmd-nd-git-cmmds.txt
Here in this repository is the git command file, basically a great cheatsheet specially for all beginers; with all necessary commands to kick off with git commandline :)
cmd-nd-git-cmmds.txt is the only main file rest all branches and files were created as a part of my git learning process; I learnt to merge branches, adding files, removing files and much much more..
Have a great time learning git...
